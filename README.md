Full-Stack = Frontend + Backend
Frontend is client facing side.
Backend is invisible to user, but contains all the logic that make a web app work.

Backend consists of three main components:
1. Sever - Basically a computer.
2. Application - All the logic that enables the web app to function.
3. Database - Where we can store and retrieve user data.

Server for live website should be on 24/7 so it can listen for incoming requests from browsers from all over the world.
Any computer that is connected to a network can act as a server.

Application is basically logic that runs on the computer or server, and it determines how we want to respond to the requests from the browser.
